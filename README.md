## *(Rough)* About Me
Hi, I’m Tyler B.

I’m interested in all manners of computer science, especially Artificial Intelligence (that's not to say I'm good with it).
I usually make small utility programs in Python but have dipped my toes in Lua, C#, JS, and more!
I appreciate the art of game design and programming, and making modifications to existing games.

## Previous Project
I designed a server-side mod for the video game FiveM (a game which piggy backs off GTA V to allow easy modding & custom servers) that provides a multiplayer gamemode.
The gamemode includes two teams of players: the military and the hunters (two very original names I know).
The military are required to travel around San Andreas in order to pickup precious military cargo (heavy-duty firearms, rocket launchers, NUKES - you know, the usual).
They must then deliver these cargo to specified drop-off points that *definitely* make sense, yes...
They must do all of this three times and then extract out of state at a specified location, all while being chased by highly-trained stealth combat professionals driving weaponized insurgents wearing long-range night vision goggles.
Did I mention the military are driving a chernobog? Is that an important detai- nah.
"Why are the american military driving a russian origin vehicle?" Shut up.

Guess what the name of the gamemode is.
Btw, did I mention I am really creative when it comes to names!
I don't know why, I just seem to have some sort of superpower when it comes to naming.
I'm like the *meaning of originality*!

I call it "The Hunter Gamemode". Ye, I lied about all of that "superpower" stuff, I'm a programmer :p

## Exeunt
If you read through all of that then have star or something.
